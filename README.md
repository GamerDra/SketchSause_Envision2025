# Pix2Pix_Envision2025

## 🛰️ Description

This project focuses on translating satellite imagery into map-like representations using image-to-image translation. Leveraging the **Pix2Pix** architecture, we employ a supervised learning approach on the [Maps dataset](https://phillipi.github.io/pix2pix/datasets/), which consists of paired satellite and map images. 

To improve training stability and potentially generate sharper outputs, the original **Pix2Pix loss function** has been replaced with the **Wasserstein GAN (WGAN) loss**. This modification alters the training dynamics to encourage a more meaningful gradient flow and reduce common GAN issues like mode collapse.

## 🧩 Solution Overview

### 🔧 Model Architecture

- **Generator**: A U-Net-based architecture that learns to map satellite images to map renderings.
- **Discriminator**: A PatchGAN-style discriminator, adapted to support the WGAN loss and trained to evaluate local image realism.
- **Loss Function**: Replaced the standard L1 + GAN loss with the WGAN loss (with gradient penalty for stability).

### 🔄 Training Pipeline

1. **Dataset**: Used the Maps dataset with aligned satellite ↔ map image pairs.
2. **Preprocessing**: Images resized to 256×256 and normalized to [-1, 1].
3. **Training**: Generator and discriminator trained alternately, enforcing the WGAN framework.
4. **Evaluation**: Visual comparison of generated maps with ground truth for qualitative performance.
